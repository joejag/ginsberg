## Ginsberg Demo App
This is a demo of an client-side application that interacts with the Ginsberg REST API.

The app allows a user to explore the corrolation between a persons mood and their total amount of sleep on any given day (days where both datasets are avaiable). Data is from [Project Ginsberg's][1] sample API servcie.

The project uses the angular.js framework and the D3 graphic library. It is served by a basic sinatra app (which acts as a proxy for Ginsberg's REST API).
